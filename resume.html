Welcome to my resume! The first part of it is a short free-form narrative, something I would be curious to read from a person I am going to work with. The second part is a more traditional bullet-list skeleton of my skills and activities.
</p>

	<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
My interests mainly emerged from math. Math shapes the way I think about computers and programming, if not how I reason overall. I enjoy solving am occasional puzzle, being a part of my high school's math team, or just conversing with someone about an interesting concept or theorem.
</p>
<p>
But these interests adapt with me. Be it a change in environment, a personal discovery, or just a new operating system, I see everything through the prism of curiosity. Once I am interested, I dig deeper and find related acquaintances. This is how I learned about Linux and the variety of its applications and tools (that I now use on a daily basis). Consequently, I wrote an <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15171332">article</a> on the application of  ML in kernel design, and maintain a handful of articles on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:Flatmoll">Arch Linux Wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy code that is relatively simple and robust, which not only accomplishes its objective, but does it in a correct, efficient, and easily explicable way. I am allergic to monstrous complexities and prefer doing things step-by-step, even beyond programming. See <a href="https://github.com/flatmoll/swaysensor">swaysensor</a> for an example of program I wrote that represents this approach.
</p>
<p>
I love contributing to open communities. Contribution is an enjoyable act by itself, but I also make sure to maintain my initial inputs. For a while, I volunteered at a laptop repair service, where I assisted in diagnosing and fixing motherboard defects and failures. My current user contributions comprise of the aforementioned ArchWiki edits and articles, as well as of polling and adding new places to <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/user/flatmoll">OpenStreetMap</a>.

<p><b>Technic Bar</b><span><i> Jul 2024 &mdash; Mar 2025 </i></span></p>
<p>
At Technic Bar, I helped with diagnostics and repair of laptop motherboards, and performed quality tests afterwards. My patient diligence in studying schematics and my communication skills helped me become a valuable assistant in this concurrent process.
</p>

<p><b>Mathematics tutor</b><span><i> May 2021 &mdash; Feb 2023 </i></span><br></p>
<p>
As a high school math tutor, I tried my best to deliver relevant knowledge in a clear and friendly manner. This experience significantly improved my communication and speaking skills. I created and assessed personalized homework assignments. Taught a total of five students.
