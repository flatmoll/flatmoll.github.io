Greetings! The first part of this resume is a short free-form narrative, something I would be interested to read about my potential colleague. The second part is a more traditional bullet-list skeleton of my skills and activities. This resume is also available in <a href="https://flatmoll.github.io/resume.pdf">PDF</a>.
</p>

	<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
My interests mainly emerged from math. Math shapes the way I think about computers and programming, if not how I reason overall. I enjoy solving an occasional puzzle and participating in math-related events.
</p>
<p>
These interests are shaped by my curisoity. Be it a new finding or environment, I dig deeper or find related acquaintances, respectively. This is how I learned about Linux, consequantly writing an <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15171332">article</a> on the application of ML in kernel design as part of my creative assignment. I also maintain a handful of articles on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:Flatmoll">Arch Linux Wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy robust and relatively simple code, which not only accomplishes its objective, but does it in a correct, efficient, and easily explicable way. I am allergic to monstrous complexities and prefer doing things step-by-step, even beyond programming. See <a href="https://github.com/flatmoll/swaysensor">swaysensor</a> for an example of program I wrote that represents this approach.
</p>
<p>
I love contributing to open communities. Contribution is an enjoyable act by itself, but I also make sure to maintain my initial inputs. For a while, I volunteered at a laptop repair service, where I assisted in diagnosing and fixing motherboard defects. My current user contributions include my activity on ArchWiki and OpenStreetMap (OSM).
</p>

<p><b>Technic Bar</b><span><i> Jul 2024 &mdash; Mar 2025 </i></span></p>
<p>
At Technic Bar, I helped with diagnostics and repair of laptop motherboards, and performed quality tests afterwards. My patient diligence in studying schematics and my communication skills helped me become a valuable assistant in this concurrent process.
</p>

<p><b>Mathematics tutor</b><span><i> May 2021 &mdash; Feb 2023 </i></span><br></p>
<p>
As a high school math tutor, I tried my best to deliver relevant knowledge in a clear and friendly manner. This experience significantly improved my communication and speaking skills. I created and assessed personalized homework assignments. Taught a total of five students.
